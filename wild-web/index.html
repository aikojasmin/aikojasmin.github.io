            <u>The Sound of Silence</u><br> By Simon and Garfunkel</br>
             <br> <br>
             [Verse 1] <br> 
             Hello darkness, my old friend <br> 
             I've come to talk with you again <br> 
             Because a vision softly creeping <br> 
             Left its seeds while I was sleeping <br> 
             And the vision that was planted in my brain <br> 
             Still remains <br> 
             Within the sound of silence <br> <br> 
            [Verse 2] <br> 
            In restless dreams, I walked alone <br> 
            Narrow streets of cobblestone <br> 
            'Neath the halo of a street lamp <br> 
            I turned my collar to the cold and damp <br> 
            When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light <br> That split the night <br> 
            And touched the sound of silence 
            <br> <br> 
            [Verse 3] <br> 
            And in the naked light, I saw <br> 
            Ten thousand people, maybe more <br> 
            People talking without speaking <br> 
            People hearing without listening <br> 
            People writing songs that voices never shared <br> 
            And no one daredvv <br> 
            Disturb the sound of silence <br> <br> 
            [Verse 4] <br> 
            "Fools" said I, "You do not know <br> 
            Silence like a cancer grows <br> 
            Hear my words that I might teach you <br> 
            Take my arms that I might reach you" <br> 
            But my words, like silent raindrops fell <br> 
            And echoed in the wells of silence 
            <br> <br> 
            [Verse 5] <br> 
            And the people bowed and prayed <br> 
            To the neon god they made <br> 
            And the sign flashed out its warning <br> 
            In the words that it was forming <br> 
            Then the sign said, "The words on the prophets are written on the subway walls <br> 
            In tenement halls" 
            <br> <br>  
            And whispered in the sound of silence 
            br> <br> <br>

            It's been a long day <br>
            Without you, my friend <br>
            And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again <br>
            We've come a long way <br>
            From where we began <br>
            Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again <br>

            All the planes we flew, good things we been through<br>
            That I'd be standin' right here talkin' to you <br>
            'Bout another path, I know we loved to hit the road and laugh <br>
            But somethin' told me that it wouldn't last <br>
            Had to switch up, look at things different, see the bigger picture <br>
            Those were the days, hard work forever pays <br>
            Now I see you in a better place<br>
            Uh <br> <br>

            [Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa] <br>
            First, you both go out your way and the vibe is feelin' strong <br>
            And what's small turned to a friendship, a friendship turned to a bond <br>
            And that bond'll never be broken, the love will never get lost <br>
            And when brotherhood come first, then the line'll never be crossed <br>
            Established it on our own when that line had to be drawn <br>
            And that line is what we reached, so remember me when <br>

            It starts with one
            <br> <br> 
            [Verse 1: Mike Shinoda, Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]<br>
            One thing, I don't know why It doesn't even matter how hard you try <br>
            Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme To explain in due time, all I know <br>
            Time is a valuable thing <br>
            Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings Watch it count down to the end of the day <br>
            The clock ticks life away, it's so unreal <br>
            Didn't look out below <br>
            Watch the time go right out the window <br>
            Tryin' to hold on, d-didn't even know <br>
            I wasted it all just to watch you go 
            <br> <br> 
            [Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda] <br>
            I kept everything inside <br>
            And even though I tried, it all fell apart <br>
            What it meant to me will eventually be <br>
            A memory of a time when I tried so hard
            <br> <br> 
            [Chorus: Chester Bennington]
            <br> 
            I tried so hard and got so far
            But in the end, it doesn't even matter
            I had to fall to lose it all
            But in the end, it doesn't even matter

            One thing, I don't know why <br>
            It doesn't even matter how hard you try <br>
            Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme <br>
            To remind myself how I tried so hard <br>
            In spite of the way you were mockin' me <br>
            Actin' like I was part of your property <br>
            Remembering all the times you fought with me <br>
            I'm surprised it got so far <br>
            Things aren't the way they were before <br>
            You wouldn't even recognize me anymore <br>
            Not that you knew me back then <br>
            But it all comes back to me in the end
            <br> <br> 
            [Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda] <br>
            You kept everything inside <br>
            And even though I tried, it all fell apart <br>
            What it meant to me will eventually be <br>
            A memory of a time when I tried so hard

            [Verse 2]<br>
            I'm feelin' electric tonight<br>
            Cruisin' down the coast, goin' 'bout 99<br>
            Got my bad baby by my heavenly side<br>
            I know, if I go, I'll die happy tonight
            <br> <br>
            [Pre-Chorus]<br>
            Oh my God, I feel it in the air<br>
            Telephone wires above are sizzlin' like a snare<br>
            Honey, I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere<br>
            Nothin' scares me anymore (One, two, three, four)
            <br> <br> 
            [Chorus]<br> 
            Kiss me hard before you go<br>
            Summertime sadness<br>
            I just wanted you to know<br>
            That, baby, you the best
            <br> <br> 
            [Post-Chorus]<br>
            I got that summertime, summertime sadness<br>
            Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness<br>
            Got that summertime, summertime sadness<br>
            Oh, oh, oh
            <br> <br> 
            [Bridge]<br>
            Think I'll miss you forever<br>
            Like the stars miss the sun in the morning sky<br>
            Later's better than never<br>
            Even if you're gone, I'm gonna drive (Drive)<br>
            Drive
            <br> <br>
            [Breakdown]<br>
            I got that summertime, summertime sadness<br>
            Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness<br>
            Got that summertime, summertime sadness<br>

            Kiss me hard before you go<br>

        The life and death of Adobe Flash 
        <br> 
        Let’s pretend we’re back in, say, 2008. You’ve just bought a new computer with Windows XP on it, hooked it up to the internet, opened the browser, navigated to your favorite website… and found that half of it doesn’t display. “Try installing Adobe Flash,” a friend who knows all about computers advises over the phone.
        <br> <br> 
        The origins of Flash date back to the early 1990s: it was a tool to create simple vector-based animations compact enough to be downloaded even over a slow internet connection via a modem.
        <br> <br> 
        By the late 2000s, Adobe Flash Player — still an animation tool at heart — was pretty much indispensable. Without it, literally half of all websites didn’t work. 
        <br> <br> 
        At the same time, cybercriminals began to utilize the dozens upon dozens of vulnerabilities found in the player. Largely because of this, since 2010, Flash has had many ardent critics, and even Adobe itself recognized that the internet needs to develop along different lines. 
        <br> <br> 
        Nevertheless, Flash’s “funeral” was drawn out for almost 10 years — and even then it wasn’t properly buried. It all makes for one of the most interesting episodes in the history of online information security.
        <br> <br> 
        Some say Steve Jobs killed Adobe Flash Player, others blame the inevitability of change. I say, it doesn't matter who did it! It's gone now. And it's never coming back. So, everyone take good hard look at themselves in the mirror and remember that life is short. Kings can fall from the highest of heights. If there's one thing Adobe Flash Player would have wanted us to remember, it would be that creativity cannot be controlled, rather it should be nurtured. Long live Adobe Flash player. Forever in our hearts.

        It was the late 90s and social media platforms like MySpace and Facebook didn't yet exist. Texting was still in its infancy as very few people actually owned mobile phones at that point. E-mail was a popular method of communication among those with access to a computer, but it lacked the real-time feel that makes in-person conversation so appealing.
        <br> <br> 
        For that, you needed an instant messaging program, and when the mainstream Internet movement really started to take root, there were four major competitors jockeying for position: AOL Instant Messenger, ICQ, Yahoo! Messenger and Microsoft's MSN Messenger.
        <br> <br> 
         MSN Messenger came out on top as every 12 year old's first choice as a means to gossip and chat to their crushes after school. From static emoticons, to later animated emoticons of large lips laughing in the middle of your screen - reminicent of a Howler from Harry Potter; It could be said that MSN paved the way for Facebook Messenger, and other apps alike. 
        <br> <br> 
        Sadly, things went from bad to worse in 2012 when Microsoft forced Windows Vista and Windows 7 users to upgrade from an older version of the app to a newer release, and dropped support for Windows XP entirely shortly after. This was around the same time Microsoft acquired Skype. 
        <br> <br> 
      On a dark day in 2013, we said farewell to MSN Messenger through teary eyes. With leaving only the memory of its homepage and chat boxes to occupy the darkest, deepest crevices of our minds. I owe my fast typing to MSN Messenger. Rest in eternal peace. Gone, but never forgotten.

          Dubbed as a site that nearly destroyed the music industry in the early 2000s, Limewire stands tall as a beacon to amateur music piracy enthusiasts. If it weren't for the many bugs and viruses Limewire sadly contracted, and the eminent destruction it posed to the music industry, it would be alive today. <br> <br>
          At its peak, there were several million people using the service to collect all the music they wanted, entirely for free, and while it’s impossible to nail down exactly how much all of that collective stealing could have been worth, there were several accounts that claimed it was somewhere between billions of dollars and trillions, though that latter suggestion is difficult to substantiate. Iconic. <br> <br>
          While Limewire was ousted of existence almost immediately, some people just can't seem to let the dead rest peacefully. There have been many attempts to resurrect the platform, but all have never made it to see the light of day. Here's to hoping Limewire can finally rest easy. <br>

          In sad news for trios of teenage girls, creepy old men, and music students whose sense of self depends entirely on fulfilling random strangers’ song requests, Omegle is officially no more. Omegle is dead. No more sleepovers dedicated to meeting weird and sometimes hot strangers from all over the world. The world is now (probably) a safer place. 
          <br> <br>
          In the statement, Brooks explains that he founded Omegle 14 years ago to build on the things he loved about the internet. “If the Internet is a manifestation of the ‘global village’,” he writes, “Omegle was meant to be a way of strolling down a street in that village, striking up conversations with the people you ran into along the way.” Which explains why it had a brief renaissance during COVID quarantines.
          <br> <br>
          For all the dark things Omegle embodied, there was also SOME positive that came out of it. Now living on in the memory of every curious teenager, Omegle will be remembered.  <br>

          After accumulating hundreds of millions of users over its 11 years, the party was finally over. Club Penguin would shutdown. The owners of Club Penguin gave users until the end of March to get their affairs and igloos in order. For the younger generation, the shutdown was the end of an era. 
          <br> <br> 
          Like Neopets and Habbo Hotel, the site helped show digital-natives the impact that virtual worlds can have on our own. Club Penguin created its own ecosystem of inside jokes, traditions, and memes, at a time where the latter was mostly limited photos of an animal and two lines of Impact font. After Donald Trump won the presidential election in 2016, protests broke out on the island, with penguins letting out text-based chants of "not my president" and "my body my choice" on the snow-covered streets. 
          <br> <br>
          In the case of Club Penguins death, it seems there must be only one suspect: MONEY. The pivot to cater to a relevant game-consuming landscape offered a better way to cash in, as in-game purchases and more frequent advertising are a standard of the industry. This clashed with Club Penguin's original mission; to serve as a space on the internet for kids to play and interact safely, free from ads. Today, there are virtually no online platforms designed for children that don't rely on sponsored content in some form. After being purchased by the Walt Disney Company for $700 million, that became true for Club Penguin as well.
          <br> <br>
          Now, Club Penguin is dead. A once thriving hub for kids to safely socialise and play is gone. Remnants of the online platform remain only as screen recordings on YouTube. Long live Club Penguin. Life will never be the same without you.

          The thing about Vine becoming the internet’s premier tool for making short-form videos is that it happened almost completely by accident. Its founders had envisioned their tool for making 6_second clips as a way to help people capture casual moments in their lives and share them with friends.
          <br> <br> This platform eventuated into a global sensation _ a platform that connected the famous with the general public in a way that made them feel like everyday people. A short-form video platform made to capture casual moments in the lives of its users became a window into the lives of the rich and famous, and the breeding ground for iconic memes, and iconic moments in pop culture that live on today.
          <br> <br>
          Now, it may seem like Vine is a distant memory, a fleeting moment in time, a blip in the Matrix. A short life, but a good one. I believe their last words were "here for a good time, not a long time".
