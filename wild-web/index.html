            <u>The Sound of Silence</u><br> By Distrubed</br>
             <br> [Verse 1] <br> Hello darkness, my old friend <br> I've come to talk with you again <br> Because a vision softly creeping <br> Left its seeds while I was sleeping <br> And the vision that was planted in my brain <br> Still remains <br> Within the sound of silence <br> <br> 
            [Verse 2] <br> In restless dreams, I walked alone <br> Narrow streets of cobblestone <br> 'Neath the halo of a street lamp <br> I turned my collar to the cold and damp <br> When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light <br> That split the night <br> And touched the sound of silence <br> <br> 
            [Verse 3] <br> And in the naked light, I saw <br> Ten thousand people, maybe more <br> People talking without speaking <br> People hearing without listening <br> People writing songs that voices never shared <br> And no one daredvv <br> Disturb the sound of silence <br> <br> 
            [Verse 4] <br> "Fools" said I, "You do not know <br> Silence like a cancer grows <br> Hear my words that I might teach you <br> Take my arms that I might reach you" <br> But my words, like silent raindrops fell <br> And echoed in the wells of silence <br> <br> 
            [Verse 5] <br> And the people bowed and prayed <br> To the neon god they made <br> And the sign flashed out its warning <br> In the words that it was forming <br> Then the sign said, "The words on the prophets are written on the subway walls <br> In tenement halls" <br> <br>  And whispered in the sound of silence <br> <br> <br> 

            <u>See You Again</u> <br> By Wiz Khalifa ft. Charlie Puth <br> <br> 
            [Chorus: Charlie Puth]
            It's been a long day
            Without you, my friend
            And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
            We've come a long way
            From where we began
            Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
            When I see you again <br> <br>
            
            [Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa] <br>
            Damn, who knew?
            All the planes we flew, good things we been through
            That I'd be standin' right here talkin' to you
            'Bout another path, I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
            But somethin' told me that it wouldn't last
            Had to switch up, look at things different, see the bigger picture
            Those were the days, hard work forever pays
            Now I see you in a better place
            Uh <br> <br> 
            
            [Refrain: Wiz Khalifa] <br> 
            How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
            Everything I went through, you were standin' there by my side
            And now you gon' be with me for the last ride <br> <br> 
            
            [Chorus: Charlie Puth & Wiz Khalifa] <br>

            The life and death of Adobe Flash 
            <br> 
            How a vector graphics editor helped create one of the internet’s most important technologies, and why it led to huge security risks.
            <br> <br> 
            Let’s pretend we’re back in, say, 2008. You’ve just bought a new computer with Windows XP on it, hooked it up to the internet, opened the browser, navigated to your favorite website… and found that half of it doesn’t display. “Try installing Adobe Flash,” a friend who knows all about computers advises over the phone.
            <br> <br> 
            The origins of Flash date back to the early 1990s: it was a tool to create simple vector-based animations compact enough to be downloaded even over a slow internet connection via a modem.
            <br> <br> 
            By the late 2000s, Adobe Flash Player — still an animation tool at heart — was pretty much indispensable. Without it, literally half of all websites didn’t work. 
            <br> <br> 
            At the same time, cybercriminals began to utilize the dozens upon dozens of vulnerabilities found in the player. Largely because of this, since 2010, Flash has had many ardent critics, and even Adobe itself recognized that the internet needs to develop along different lines. 
            <br> <br> 
            Nevertheless, Flash’s “funeral” was drawn out for almost 10 years — and even then it wasn’t properly buried. It all makes for one of the most interesting episodes in the history of online information security.
